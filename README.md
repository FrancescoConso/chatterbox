Project developed for the Operating Systems exam in A.A. 2017/2018 at Pisa University

I'm saving this for posterity. To be fair I prefer to work in OOP but the resulting code was clean enough to be worthwile to look at. It was the first "big" project for an exam at University and taught me effective usage of pointers and some software engineering. Props to my colleague Andrea for his help in debugging when times were dire.
